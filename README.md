Maze
======

A short OpenGL program by Kyle J Aleshire

To compile on UNIX, Linux or Mac OS X:
    % make
Or to compile the C++ version:
    % make cpp

To run:
    % ./3dmaze <width> <height>

The program will generate a single maze of size width x height and a crudely rendered specimen of rodentia which can be controlled using the arrow keys. On reaching the exit, the program will simply freeze (too much effort to implement a proper end sequence).

Happy mazing!
